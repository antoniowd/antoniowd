Fullstack web developer for some time. I really like to read, learn and build new things.

I have a good base of HTML, CSS and Javascript and an excellent domain in the technology stack of NodeJS, ReactJS, Typescript, MySQL and MongoDB. I work as a freelancer and I've developed billing, inventory and business management systems.

In the future I want to continue improving my knowledge as a programmer and create solutions that help other people.
