Self-taught web developer for some time. I really like to read, learn and build new things.

I work as a freelancer, with a greater specialization in the backend. I have developed billing, inventory and business management systems. I have also developed some price comparators as personal projects; using web scraping to extract the necessary data from the websites.

I have a good base of HTML, CSS and Javascript and an excellent domain in the technology stack of NodeJS, ReactJS, MySQL and MongoDB

In the future I want to continue improving my knowledge as a programmer and create solutions that help other people
